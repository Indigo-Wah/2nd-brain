# 2nd-brain

2nd-brain is a movement across Obsidian users to document, note, and journal their brains. This will be my 4th attempt at starting and maintaining a Second Brain.

## Let's set scope:
I have an agreement with myself:
- [[README#Note what you can|Note what you can]]
- [[README#Note what you should|Note what you should]]
- [[README#Note imperfectly|Note imperfectly]]

### Note what you can
Note everything I can, everything I can will myself too, everything I want to. Note it in as much or as little detail as I wish. 

### Note what you should
Try very hard to note the things that should be noted, even if it is difficult, even if you do not want to.

### Note imperfectly
Embrace imperfection, do not fear it. It will go wrong, and when it does, improve, but never stop.
