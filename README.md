# 2nd-brain

2nd-brain is a movement across Obsidian users to document, note, and journal their brains. This will be my 4th attempt at starting and maintaining a Second Brain.

## Let's set scope:
I have an agreement with myself:
- [[README#Note what you can|Note what you can]]
- [[README#Note what you should|Note what you should]]
- [[README#Note imperfectly|Note imperfectly]]

### Note what you can
Note everything I can, everything I can will myself too, everything I want to. Note it in as much or as little detail as I wish. 

### Note what you should
Try very hard to note the things that should be noted, even if it is difficult, even if you do not want to.

### Note imperfectly
Embrace imperfection, do not fear it. It will go wrong, and when it does, improve, but never stop.

## GitHub

This repo may be available on GitHub but is not built for GitHub... It is built for Obsidian and uses the associated Obsidian flavor of Markdown. Feel free to clone this done into Obsidian or a Markdown viewer with support for this flavor for best viewing experience.
