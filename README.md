# 2nd-brain

2nd-brain is a movement across Obsidian users to document, note, and journal their brains. This will be my 4th attempt at starting and maintaining a Second Brain.

- Note what you should
- Note imperfectly

### Note what you can
Note everything I can, everything I can will myself too, everything I want to. Note it in as much or as little detail as I wish. 

### Note what you should
