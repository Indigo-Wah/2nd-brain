# Code Word System

DocType:: System
People:: Me, Gopnik
InEffect:: True

## The Code Word

The code word is "Extreme Pineapple".
Chosen for it's randomness and otherwise unlikely use in conversation.

## Requirements

No requirements need to be met to use the code word. This means that regardless of current context, you are able to use the word. No information needs to be given as to why, how long, or anything else. 

## Functionality

Once the word is said, the person that said it notifies the other person that they can not talk right now, but they are safe and okay.
